# Company Brand Changer
Company Brand Changer is a purely cosmetic mod that allows you to change the visual brand of any building in your city that currently houses a company.
With just a few clicks, swap out logos, signs, and branding styles on commercial, industrial or office buildings to better fit to your vision.

Note: This mod does not affect the building's underlying company or function.
For example, an "Office_Bank" producing "Financial" will continue to do so, even if an "Electronics" brand is assigned. Only the visual branding and selected building colors updates — the simulation remains unchanged.

Features:
* **Change Building Brands**: Access any building with a company, and instantly switch its brand.
* **Building Seed Randomization**: A bonus feature that let's you randomize the building's seed — reshuffling the colors and props like trees, fences, and billboards.
